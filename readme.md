## Project Overview

This repository contains the backend implementation for the **RewardsConverter System**, developed as part of the **JPMorgan Chase SWE simulation** on Forage. The system handles the conversion of reward values between **cash** and **miles**.

### Features

- **Reward Conversion:** Convert between cash and airline miles using a conversion rate of **1 mile = $0.0035**.
- **RewardValue Class:** Implements constructors for both cash and miles values, enabling flexible reward calculations.
- **Test Coverage:** Includes unit tests to validate conversions between cash and miles.

### Project Structure

- `.git`
- `.gitignore`
- `pom.xml`
- `src`
  - `main`
    - `java`
       - `RewardValue.java`
  - `test`
    - `java`
       - `RewardValueTests.java`

### Future Enhancements

- **Currency Support:** Introduce support for additional reward types beyond cash and miles.
- **Optimization:** Improve the conversion efficiency by implementing caching techniques for repetitive conversions.
- **API Integration:** Add RESTful API endpoints to expose the reward conversion functionalities for broader use.

### Unit Testing

Unit tests ensure that the conversion between miles and cash operates as expected, covering edge cases and large value calculations.
